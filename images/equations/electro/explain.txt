1|Coulomb's Law: The magnitude of the electrostatic force, in Newtons,_between two point charges in vacuum is directly proportional to the_magnitudes of each charge and inversely proportional to the square_of the distance between the charges.
2|Potential (stored energy in Joules; U sub E) is equal to a point charge (q)_multiplied by the change in electric potential (V).
3|This is essentially Coulomb's law without the square of the separation_term (r), and only one charge value (q). The use is to find voltage,_as opposed to electrostatic force.
4|Electric Field (Volts/Meter OR Newtons/Coulomb) is equal to the change_in Voltage/electric potential (V) over the change in separation (r).
5|The change in Electric Potential (Volts) is equal to Charge (Q) over_Capacitance (C).
6|Capacitance in farads is directly proportional to the product of the_dielectric constant (k) and the permittivity of a vacuum (Epsilon Naught)_multiplied by the area of the plate (or otherwise) over the_separation between the two (d).
7|Electric Field (Volts/Meter OR Newtons/Coulomb) is equal to Charge (Q)_over the product of the Permittivity of a Vacuum (Epsilon Naught) and_the Area (A).
8|The potential energy (Joules) of a capacitor is equal to one-half of_the charge (1/2 Q) times the potential difference (V) which is equal to_one-half of the capacitance (1/2 C) times the potential difference_squared (V²).
9|Current in Amperes (I) is directly proportional to the change in Charge_(Q) over the change in time (t, seconds).
10|The Resistance (R) of an object (Ohms) is equal to the product of the_object's resistivity (p) and length (l) divided by the Area of the object (A). 
11|Power (Watts) is directly proportional to Current (I) multiplied by_the Voltage (V). A simpler form is P=IV.
12|Current in Amperes (I) is equal to Voltage (V) over Resistance (R)._The famous form is V=IR.
13|Used to calculate resistance in series. The resistance in series is_equal to the sum of each resistor added. The sigma is just a fancy way of_addition notation. 
14|Used for resistors in parallel. The inverse of the resistance in parallel_is equal to the inverse of the value of each resistor added_( I.e. 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/67). 
15|Used for capacitors in parallel. The capacitance (C, farads) is equal to_the added values of each capacitor. Think of this equation as akin to_the Resistors in Series Equation.
16|Used for series capacitors. The inverse of the total capacitance is equal_to the sum of the inverses of each value of capacitor in the series._Think of this equation akin to The Resistors in Parallel Equation.

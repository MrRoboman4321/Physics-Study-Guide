1|Pressure is equal to force divided by area.
2|Energy transfered to the system by heating divided by the change in time is equal to\nthe thermal conductivity of the object times area times change in temperature,\ndivided by the thickness of the object. An use for this equation is finding the\nthermal energy transfered into a room through a piece of glass with area 6 m^2 and\na thickness of 2 cm, with a change of temperature between the inside and the outside\nof 20 degrees.

1|Pressure is equal to force divided by area.

2|Energy transfered to the system by heating divided by the change in time is equal to_the thermal conductivity of the object times area times change in temperature,_divided by the thickness of the object. An use for this equation is finding the_thermal energy transfered into a room through a piece of glass with area 6 m^2 and_a thickness of 2 cm, with a change of temperature between the inside and the outside_of 20 degrees.

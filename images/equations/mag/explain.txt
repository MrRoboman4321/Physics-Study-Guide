1|Force of magnetism, measured in Newton’s per Ampere meter, or Tesla, is equal_to the charge at a point times the speed of the charge, times the strength of_the magnetic field (A/m).
2|The force of magnetism in Tesla's is equal to current measured in Amperes_times the length of the electromagnet, times the strength of the generated_magnetic field (A/m).
3|The EMF, (Electro Magnetic Force), is equal to the strength of the magnetic_field times length of the electromagnet, times the speed of a point charge in m/s.
4|Strength of the magnetic field is equal to vacuum permeability (4 pi*10^-7 (Tesla meters/Ampere))_divided by 2 pi, times current in Amperes divided by separation distance.

1|Pressure is equal to force divided by area. Pressure is measured in Pascals and force_is measured in Newtons. A modification of this equation is F=P*A, which is also useful.
2|Energy of a system, measured in Joules, divided by the change in time is equal to_thermal conductivity, measured in watts per meter-kelvin, times area times change in _temperature divided by thickness of the material.
3|Pressure, measured in Pascals, times volume, is equal to the number of moles_times molar volume times temperature. Molar volume is equal to R=0.08206 when rounded_to four significant figures. Pressure times volume is also equal to the number of molecules_times Boltzmann constant (kB=1.38*10^-23 J/K), times temperature measured in Kelvin.
4|Kinetic energy, measured in Joules, is equal to 3/2 times Boltzmann constant_(kB=1.38*10^-23 J/K), times temperature measured in kelvin. 
5|Work, measured in Joules, is equal to negative pressure, measured in Pascal’s,_times the change in volume.
6|The change in internal energy, measured in Kelvin, is equal to energry_transfered to a system by heating plus work done by a system. 
oracle|We see dimly in the Present what is small and what is great,_Slow of faith how weak an arm may turn the iron helm of fate,_But the soul is still oracular; amid the market’s din,_List the ominous stern whisper from the Delphic cave within,—_“They enslave their children’s children who make compromise with sin.”

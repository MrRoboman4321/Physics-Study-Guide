1|Wavelength (lambda) is proportional to the speed (v)_through with the light travels over the frequency (f).
2|The index of refraction (n) is equal to the speed of_light (c, check constants if not memorized) over the_speed of light through the medium (v). 
3|Snell's law. The index of refraction (n1) multiplied_by the angle of incidence (theta 1) in a medium is equal_to the product of the index of refraction (n2) and angle of_reflection (theta 2) of a second medium.
4|The inverse of the focal length (f) is equivalent to_the inverse of the object distance (Si) added to the_inverse of the image distance (So). 
5|Magnification is equal to the height of the image (Hi)_over the height of the object (Ho). It is also equal to_the distance of the image (Si) over the distance of the_object (So). 
6|Equation for the Double Slit Experiment: the distance_between two slits (d) multiplied by the angle of a spot_on the screen and the midline (theta) is equal to an_integer (m) multiplied by the wavelength (lambda).

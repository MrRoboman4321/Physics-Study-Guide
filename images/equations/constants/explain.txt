1|The mass of an electron is used in Modern physics, to find the_momentum of light when calculating the de Broglie wavelength.
2|The universal gas constant is used in Thermodynamic in the_equation PV=nRT.
3|Boltzmann's constant is used in Thermodynamics.
4|The charge of an electron is used in Electronics, to find_things such as force of an electric field and strength_of a field at a given point.
5|1 electron volt is an useful converter between Joules (J)_to Electron Volts (eV).
6|The speed of light is used in Waves and Optics, and Modern_Physics.
7|Gravity constant is the force due to gravity, which is_useful in Fluid Dynamics and calculating pressure.
8|Acceleration due to gravity is useful in Fluid Dynamics_to calculate pressure of a system and buoyant force.
9|Plank's constant is very useful for Modern Physics._Planckï¿½s constant is required to calculate energy of a_wave, max kinetic energy, and the de Broglie wavelength.
10|This is most useful for the Electronics Unit.
11|Couloumb's Constant is used for Coulomb's law.
12|Useful for Fluids.

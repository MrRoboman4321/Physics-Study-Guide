1|The mass of an electron is used in Modern physics, to find the_momentum of light whencalculating the de Broglie wavelength
2|The universal gas constant is used in Thermodynamic in the_equation PV=nRT
3|Boltzmann's constant is used in Thermodynamics
4|The charge of an electron is used in Electronics, to find_things such as force of an electric field and strength_of a field at a given point
5|1 electron volt is an useful converter between Joules (J)_to Electron Volts (eV)
6|The speed of light is used in Waves and Optics, and Modern_physics
7|Gravity constant is the force due to gravity, which is_useful in Fluid Dynamics and calculating pressure
8|Acceleration due to gravity is useful in Fluid Dynamics_to calculate pressure of a system and bouyant force
9|Plank's constant is very useful for Modern Physics._Plank's constant is required to calculate energy of a_wave, max kinetic energy, and the de Broglie wavelength
